# HTTP Response Signing and Digesting Project (RFC 9421)

# Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for signing and digesting HTTP responses (see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9421/). Signing and digesting HTTP responses are crucial security measures to ensure the integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of server-generated content sent back to clients. By implementing these features, the project enhances the security posture of web applications and APIs, fostering trust among users and preventing various forms of attacks such as data tampering and injection.
Features :

* HTTP Response Signing: Utilizes cryptographic techniques to sign HTTP responses, guaranteeing the authenticity and integrity of the server's messages.
* HTTP Response Digesting: Computes digests of HTTP responses, enabling clients to verify the integrity of the received content and detect any unauthorized alterations.
* Key Management: Provides robust key management capabilities, including key generation, storage, rotation, and revocation, ensuring secure handling of cryptographic keys.
* Algorithm Support: Supports a wide range of cryptographic algorithms for signing and digesting HTTP responses, allowing users to choose algorithms based on their security requirements and preferences.
* Configuration Options: Offers flexible configuration options to customize the behavior of response signing and digesting, such as algorithm selection, key lengths, and key management policies.
* Interoperability: Designed to seamlessly integrate with existing web frameworks and middleware, ensuring compatibility and ease of adoption without significant modifications.
* Documentation: Comprehensive documentation covering installation instructions, usage guidelines, API references, and best practices for securing HTTP responses.

# Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository from GitHub: git clone [https://github.com/PilouGit/httpsign.git](https://github.com/PilouGit/httpsign)
* Navigate to the project directory: cd your_project
   
# Usage

To use the project for signing and digesting HTTP responses, follow these general steps:

* Initialize the response signer/digestor module with appropriate configuration settings.
* Generate cryptographic keys or import existing ones as per your key management strategy.
* Integrate the module into your web application or server middleware to automatically sign and digest outgoing HTTP responses.
* Optionally, provide endpoints or utilities for clients to verify signatures and digests of received responses.

For detailed usage instructions and code examples, refer to the project documentation.
